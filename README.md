# MoneyCruncher by Alex Segura 
This Project will be an expense tracker that can track what you spend every day and give back simple data such as spending for the week, day, or month. It will also be able to track increases or decreases in spending through the weeks. Additionally, it will track large purchases. 
I want to build this as many people that I know and see struggle with overspending, so making a simple app that can track spending and tell you if you spend more or less daily or weekly. I belive that money management is a good skill to have as money is somthing we could all use more of. 


My plan will consist of steadily building up the means to gather and store the input of the user, then making data storage systems to allow easy access and usage of the inputted data. Then the system of gathering the data from both the last day and the past week will be made using lists.
Since I am doing this alone I will end up contributing all the work but over time slowly. I plan on dividing up the work over weeks to allow me not to not run out of time and stress free.
